    Provides the HTTP actions for interacting with an HTTP server. Apart from the standard HTTP methods, `forward()`
    and `execute()` functions are provided. `forward()` takes an incoming HTTP requests and sends it to an upstream
    HTTP endpoint while `execute()` can be used for sending HTTP requests with custom verbs. More complex and specific
    endpoint types can be created by wrapping this generic HTTP actions implementation.

    F{{config}} The configurations of the client endpoint associated with this HttpActions instance
}
public type CallerActions object {
    //These properties are populated from the init call to the client connector as these were needed later stage
    //for retry and other few places.
